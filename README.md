# mongoose-app
An app I developed for practising my JavaScript skills with Mongoose, Express.JS and Node.JS.

First, I created the folder, so then I inserted the commando "npm init" to install the node modules.

Then, I installed the Express.JS using the command "npm install express", so after that I could use the method "require()".

As a last step I installed the Mongoose modules with the "npm install mongoose" command.

This app is still being developed.
