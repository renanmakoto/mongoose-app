# mongoose-app
An app I developed for practising my JavaScript skills with Mongoose, Express.JS and Node.JS.

First, I created the folder, so then I inserted the commando "npm init" to install the node modules.

Then, I installed the Express.JS using the command "npm install express", so after that I could use the method "require()".

As a last step I installed the Mongoose modules with the "npm install mongoose" command.

This app is still being developed.

The codes were better organized in order make them more readable. Which means they were put into different folders.
